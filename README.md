Here's a step-by-step guide to installing the required libraries:

Step 1: Install OpenCV
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command: pip install opencv-python
3. Press Enter to run the command.

Step 2: Install PySerial
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command: pip install pyserial
3. Press Enter to run the command.

Step 3: Install MediaPipe
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command: pip install mediapipe
3. Press Enter to run the command.

Verify Installation
After installing the libraries, you can verify that they were installed correctly by running a simple test script.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation, try the following:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of pip installed: pip install --upgrade pip
2. Try installing the libraries using a virtual environment.
3. Check for any conflicts with other libraries or packages.

The libraries used in the code are:

1. OpenCV (cv2): A computer vision library for image and video processing.
2. PySerial (serial): A library for communicating with serial devices, such as Arduino.
3. MediaPipe (mp): A library for machine learning-based media processing, including hand tracking.

By following these steps, you should be able to install the required libraries and run the codeÂ successfully.
